**Giftos** is a fully developed e-commerce web application built using the Laravel framework with Blade templating, designed to provide a modern and user-friendly shopping experience. The project showcases a complete online store system that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and complete their purchases through a structured checkout process. The frontend layout is crafted using Laravel Blade and styled with Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness and clarity across all devices. On the backend, Giftos takes full advantage of Laravel’s powerful routing, controller logic, and ORM capabilities, making it both maintainable and scalable. Users can register, log in, and manage their orders, while administrators have access to a secure dashboard where they can manage product data, track orders, and monitor store activity. This project demonstrates practical implementation of real-world features such as session-based carts, order validation, user authentication, and CRUD operations, making it a strong portfolio piece for developers who want to showcase their skills in modern PHP development with Laravel. Giftos emphasizes clean code structure, component reuse, and follows Laravel’s MVC architecture, making it not only functional but also a solid base for further e-commerce development.
