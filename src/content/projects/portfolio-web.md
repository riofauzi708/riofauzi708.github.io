I built the **Mokoworkwear Shopify Website** to create a fast, scalable online storefront that showcases the brand’s **ready-stock workwear** and drives direct sales across Indonesia. My goal was to deliver a seamless shopping experience that feels polished and professional on any device while remaining easy for the internal team to maintain. Using **Shopify Online Store 2.0** with a heavily customized Dawn theme, I combined **Liquid**, **HTML5**, **SCSS/CSS3**, and **vanilla JavaScript** to craft a clean, mobile-first design with smooth interactive elements like a custom mega menu and autoplay hero slideshow. I integrated **Shopify Search & Discovery**, **Google Analytics**, and **Meta Pixel** to improve product discovery and track conversions, while optimizing performance and SEO to achieve sub-two-second load times and strong organic visibility. The result is a high-performance e-commerce site that reflects Mokoworkwear’s brand identity, increases nationwide reach, and provides a maintainable platform for ongoing growth.
